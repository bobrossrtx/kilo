# Kilo
## A nano like a terminal text editor

### Setup
#### Building from source
To build a kilo from the source, you are going to have to be running on a Unix operating system. You can build kilo through WSL, Cygwin, or even Windows bash if you are running on Microsoft Windows 10.

First off, you are going to need to make. With make, you can set up functions that execute commands that are made to make building C/C++ Projects easier.
To install make on Debian-based Linux distributions, you can run ```sudo apt install make```.

You should be able to compile straight from there, but just in case, you might need to install GNU/gcc, which is a C Runtime compile that allows the user to compile C into binary executables. To install, it is as simple as typing ```sudo apt install gcc``` into your terminal. 

From then on, you can easily install Kilo. What you have to do is type ```make all``` into your terminal and it will remove any already existing binaries, and replace them with the updated ones.
